### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide visualized data in the hopes of securing an investor for my business in Hawaii.  Although the concept is sound, the investor has expressed concerns over the weather from personal experience.  I have compiled weather data for the months of June and December to gain his confidence and hopefully, investment. Using the ‘dt.timedelta()’ function and flask we looked at the previous year’s precipitation in Hawaii.
