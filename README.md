### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide visualized data in the hopes of securing an investor for my business in Hawaii.  Although the concept is sound, the investor has expressed concerns over the weather from personal experience.  I have compiled weather data for the months of June and December to gain his confidence and hopefully, investment. Using the ‘dt.timedelta()’ function and flask we looked at the previous year’s precipitation in Hawaii.    

## Results: 
-	Key Differences in December and June 
-	June is shaping up to be a better month for travel with warmer temperatures and less precipitation.
-	The lowest temperature in December is 10 degrees cooler than the lowest temperature in June. Now that may not seem like a lot, but 54 degrees FEELS a lot different than 64 degrees.  The older crowd may not like the cooler weather for travel.

## Summary: 
-	Having an additional query that is for a longer spread of time, may prepare you for a longer run in the business.  Expanding the date query could provide additional information not available in the one-year query performed. 
-	For this challenge, we focused on the months between June and December.  Hawaii is noted for having mild weather all year long.  What if we looked at the data between January and May? What would we see?  How much more precipitation is there between the months in January and May. What about the ages of visitors? Are they young or old? Can the local population sustain the business in the months that lull?
